📌 Project Description

🤖⚙️ **AI with Mechanics** is a project that integrates **Artificial Intelligence** with **Mechanical Engineering** workflows such as **CAD Modeling**, **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**, and **CNC Automation**. The goal is to **improve accuracy**, **automate repetitive tasks**, and **enhance model performance** in design and manufacturing.

📐 Using **Python + CAD APIs**, engineers can create and adjust 3D models, apply **forces, loads, and stress conditions**, and predict performance metrics like **tension, strain, and balance**. AI models help in forecasting outcomes, reducing simulation time, and optimizing mechanical design iterations.

🧮 Through **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**, the system evaluates structural integrity under different loads. Machine learning algorithms improve decision-making by learning patterns from CAD parameters and simulation results.

🛠️ The project also explores **Fusion 360 for CAD**, **ESP8266/Arduino (if extended for automation)**, and **CNC workflows** for connecting design with manufacturing.

🚀 For deployment, the entire system is **Dockerized**, ensuring **portability, scalability, and easy collaboration**. Engineers can build, test, and run AI-powered mechanical workflows inside isolated environments without worrying about dependency conflicts.

🌐 With Docker integration, the project can be hosted on the web, making **AI-driven mechanical insights accessible** to teams, industries, and educational institutes.
