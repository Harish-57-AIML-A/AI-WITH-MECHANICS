AI with Mechanics is the integration of artificial intelligence techniques with mechanical engineering processes such as CAD modeling, Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and CNC automation. The goal is to improve accuracy, automate repetitive tasks, and enhance model performance in design and manufacturing.

By using machine learning models, engineers can predict outcomes like stress, strain, load distribution, and deformation directly from CAD parameters, reducing the time required for simulations. This enables faster design iterations, optimized manufacturing processes, and cost-effective solutions.

When deployed through platforms like Docker, AI-driven mechanical tools become portable, scalable, and easily accessible across different teams and environments.
