AI WITH MECHANICS: STRESS PREDICTOR 🤯

This Jupyter Notebook showcases a simplified **AI-powered stress prediction model** designed to merge the worlds of Machine Learning (ML) and Structural Mechanics. ⚙️

---

### 🎯 **Objective:**
To train a simple $\text{Scikit-learn}$ model (e.g., Linear Regression) that learns the fundamental mechanical relationship: **Stress $\approx$ Load / Area**.

---

### 💡 **Process:**

1.  **Data Generation:** Create synthetic data for **Load** ($\text{N/lb}$) and **Area** ($\text{mm}^2/\text{in}^2$) with a dash of noise 📈 to mimic real-world variability.

2.  **Model Training:** The AI model is trained to accurately predict **Stress** ($\text{MPa/psi}$) from the input features.

3.  **Classification Logic:** A critical threshold is defined (e.g., $150 \text{ MPa}$).

4.  **Prediction & Classification:** The model predicts stress for new components and classifies the outcome:
    * **$\text{Stress} < \text{Threshold}$** $\rightarrow$ **SAFE** 🟢 (Green Zone)
    * **$\text{Stress} \geq \text{Threshold}$** $\rightarrow$ **UNSAFE** 🔴 (Red Zone)
