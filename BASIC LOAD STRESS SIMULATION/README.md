🏗️ Load & Stress Simulation

⚙️ **Load and Stress Simulation** is used to study how mechanical components behave when subjected to **forces, tension, and pressure**. By applying different loads to a **CAD model**, engineers can observe how the material responds in terms of **stress distribution, strain, and deformation**.

📐 In this project, **basic simulation logic** is implemented using **Python conditions (`if`, `else`)** to represent how an object reacts under varying loads. For example:

* If load < safe limit → ✅ Model remains stable
* If load ≈ threshold → ⚠️ Warning of possible stress concentration
* If load > failure limit → ❌ Model deformation or breakage

🧮 By combining **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** with AI-based prediction, the simulation helps in:

* Estimating **maximum load capacity**
* Identifying **weak zones** in the design
* Improving **CAD model performance** before physical prototyping

🚀 This forms the foundation for **AI-assisted mechanical design**, making products safer, more reliable, and cost-efficient.
