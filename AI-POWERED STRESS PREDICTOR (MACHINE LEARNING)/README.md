🤖 AI-Powered Stress Predictor (Mini Project)

⚙️ The **AI-Powered Stress Predictor** is a simplified machine learning project that uses **Scikit-learn** to estimate **stress levels** in mechanical components based on input parameters such as **load, material strength, cross-sectional area, and safety factor**.

---

📊 Instead of running full **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**, this project demonstrates how **ML models** can learn from sample datasets of **load–stress relationships** and quickly predict whether a design is **safe, near failure, or unstable**.

---

✨ **Workflow**

1. 📂 Collect sample data → (Load, Area, Material Strength → Stress/Failure outcome).
---
2. 🧮 Train a **Regression/Classification model** using Scikit-learn (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree).
---
3. 🔍 Input a new load condition → AI predicts **stress value or failure risk**.
---
4. 🚦 Output gives a **safe/unsafe label** for quick design checks.
---

🚀 This **mini-project** showcases how **AI can complement mechanics** by providing **fast, approximate predictions** for stress analysis before performing detailed simulations. It reduces trial-and-error and helps engineers focus on optimized designs.
